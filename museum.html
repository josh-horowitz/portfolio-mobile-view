			<p>Museum photography requires keeping track of a few important things. First, many museums have rules around photography or flash photography so knowing what the rules are is an important part of getting the best images. If you know you aren't allowed to use a flash, you know you'll be working with much less light. Many exhibits are also enclosed in glass cases which, when you use a flash, end up with a reflection of the light instead of the image you want. Another tip is to make sure you get the label on the exhibit either in the image, or as it's own photograph so you remember what you took pictures of.</p>
			<p>In my experience, I like using a wide-angle lens (something with a focal length of 35mm or less). This allows me to get really close to the items and stay out of other museum visitors' ways. Low light requires a slow shutter speed so I also tend to bring a tripod with me to help keep the camera stable and prevent any shaking. Below are some pictures I took on my trips to Israel and Italy prior to the pandemic.</p>
