				<figcaption>Melissa Alcena - “I think there’s inspiration to be had wherever you are, if you make efforts to look for it. My focus for the past few years has been in creating an interest in the working class Bahamian and in those who I feel are overlooked in our society. One of the worst things you can do to a person or a group of people is to ignore them, because in doing so they almost become obsolete—so throughout my work I’m always exploring ways for people to be seen.”</figcaption>

				<figcaption>Myesha Evon - "My work examines cultural, social and personal experiences while redefining themes of legacy, love, and labor within the Black community. My practice borrows from visual traditions ranging from photographic to figurative portraiture, photo documentation, and editorial conception. I’m visually inspired by the materiality of black culture and its expression as seen through music, fashion, and family history. It is important to tell stories of my community, which has been historically left out of the conversation."</figcaption>
